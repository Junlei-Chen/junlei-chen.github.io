I was born and raised in Xi'an, Shaanxi, China and lived there for 18 years. I moved to Beijing for my undergraduate study at Peking University. In 2018, I came to Zürich, Switzerland for my Master's degree at University of Zurich and lived there for three years and enjoyed my time there a lot. Since 2021, I have been living and woking in Philadelphia, U.S. for my current job at the University of Pennsylvania.

## Beijing

Coming from China's historic capital Xi'an, a comparatively less developed place in modern China, the four years spent in Beijing at Peking University were academically tough but also intellectually rewarding.

## Switzerland

I truly enjoyed the three years I spent in Zürich, where I formed lifelong friendships with people from all over the world, broadened my perspective by living abroad for the first time, and even met my husband <a href="https://axboehm.com/" style="color: #990000; text-decoration: none;">Alexander Boehm</a> who is from Germany :D. Being a foreigner in a country where you do not completely understand the language is not easy, but luckily I met so many warm-hearted people there who were (and still are!) very genuine and always willing to help!

## Places visited around the Europe

While being a "liquidity-constrained" student, who is still accumulating human capital, I still tried to visit as many other places in Europe as possible.
