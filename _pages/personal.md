I was born and raised in Xi'an, Shaanxi, China until 18 years old and then moved to Beijing for my undergraduate study at Peking University for four years. In 2018, I came to Zurich, Switzerland for my Master's degree at University of Zurich and lived there for 3 years. Since 2021, I live and work in Philadelphia, U.S. for my current job at Penn Wharton Budget Model.

## Beijing

Coming from a financially/educationally way less developed city Xi'an, the 4 years spent in Beijing at Peking University was academically tough but also intellectually rewarding.

## Switzerland

I truly enjoyed the three years I spent in Zürich, where I formed lifelong friendships with people from all over the world, broadened my perspective by living abroad for the first time, and even met my husband <a href="https://axboehm.com/" style="color: #990000; text-decoration: none;">Alexander Boehm</a> who is from Germany :D. Being a foreigner in a country where you do not understand the language fully is not easy, but luckily I met so many warm-hearted people there who are genuine and always willing to help!

## Places visited around the Europe

While being a "liquidity-constrained" student who is still acumulating my human capital, I still try to visit as many other places in Europe as possible.
