I was born and raised in Xi'an, Shaanxi, China until 18 years old and then moved to Beijing for my undergraduate study at Peking University for 4 years. In 2018, I came to Zurich, Switzerland for my Master's degree at University of Zurich and lived there (where I also met my husband <a href="https://axboehm.com/" style="color: #990000; text-decoration: none;">Alexander Boehm</a> who is from Germany :D) for 3 years. Since 2021, I live and work in Philadelphia, U.S. for my current job at Penn Wharton Budget Model.

### Beijing

The 4 years spent in Peking University was academically tough but also intellectually rewarding.
