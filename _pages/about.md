Welcome to my personal website!

I am currently an Associate Economist at [Penn Wharton Budget Model](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/) at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. I work under the direction of [Prof. Kent Smetters](https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/smetters/).

I received my M.A. in Business and Economics from [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) and B.A. in Economics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).
